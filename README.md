Data Processing Tool
Overview

This repository contains a Python script for processing input data and generating output files based on numerical analysis. The script serves as a versatile tool for analyzing numerical data sets, providing frequency counts and statistical insights.
Features

    Reads input data from text files.
    Processes numerical data to generate frequency counts.
    Writes the analyzed data to output files.

How to Use

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-processing-tool.git

Navigate to the Repository:

bash

cd data-processing-tool

Run the Script:

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Execute the script by running the following command:

    bash

        python process_data.py

    Input Data:
        Place your input data files (e.g., in10.txt, in100.txt) in the root directory of the repository.
        Each input file should contain numerical data, with one number per line.

    Output:
        The script will generate corresponding output files (e.g., out10_sample_actual.txt, out100_sample_actual.txt) in the root directory.
        Each output file will contain processed data based on the input.

Example

Suppose you have an input file in10.txt with the following content:

5
1 2 3
2 3 4
4 5 5

Running the script will generate an output file out10_sample_actual.txt with the following content:

0 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 5 5
